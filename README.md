# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification – My First ML Project

This is my first machine learning project where I built a classifier to identify the species of an Iris flower based on its sepal and petal measurements.  
The model is trained on the classic [Iris dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) using **scikit-learn**.

## 🧠 What I Did

- 📊 Loaded and preprocessed the Iris dataset
- ✂️ Split the dataset into training and testing sets (80/20)
- 🤖 Trained and compared **3 ML models**:
  - Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - Logistic Regression
- 📈 Evaluated each model using a **classification report**
- 🔮 Made predictions on **custom input data**

## 📁 Files

- `main.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with all code, steps, and outputs

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 🐍
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📦 Dataset Source

This project uses the Iris flower dataset downloaded from Kaggle:

🔗 [Iris Species Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris)

Originally published by the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## 📌 How to Run

1. Clone this repo:

2. Open `main.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.

3. Run all cells step by step.

## 🚀 What's Next?

- Add more models (Random Forest, KNN, Naive Bayes)
- Add accuracy comparison bar chart
- Add feature scaling and cross-validation
- Build a simple **Streamlit web app** for real-time predictions
- Deploy the model online
